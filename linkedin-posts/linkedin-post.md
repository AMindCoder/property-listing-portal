## Topic: Software as a Commodity

---

**Software is now a commodity.**

Three forces have converged to make this possible:

→ AI-assisted development — what took 6 months now takes weeks
→ Cloud infrastructure costs dropped 90% (Vercel, Supabase, Railway vs traditional AWS)
→ Enterprise-grade open-source tools — Next.js, React, PostgreSQL — now free for everyone

---

**Here's what changed:**

For decades, custom software was a luxury reserved for companies with massive IT budgets. Small business owners — property dealers, contractors, manufacturers — had two choices:

1. Pay monthly rent to platforms that took their leads, their data, and their margins
2. Go without

The economics simply didn't work. A dealer earning ₹30-40 lakhs/year couldn't justify ₹15-20 lakhs for software. So they stayed dependent — paying ₹5-6 lakhs annually to platforms that owned the customer relationship.

---

**That equation has flipped.**

AI-assisted development, commoditized cloud infrastructure, and mature open-source tools have collapsed the cost of custom software by 80-90%.

What this means: The 60+ million MSMEs in India — the backbone of our economy — can now own their digital infrastructure instead of renting it.

No more paying commissions on every lead.
No more generic workflows that don't fit how you actually work.
No more building someone else's platform with your data.

Software is becoming a commodity. The question is no longer "can you afford custom?" — it's "can you afford not to own?"

**What do you think — are we at an inflection point for small business digital ownership?**
