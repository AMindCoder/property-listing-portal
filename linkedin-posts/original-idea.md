Software is Now a Commodity

With AI coding tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and others — building custom software is no longer a 6-month endeavor spending hundreds of thousands of dollars.

  Three forces have converged to make this possible:

  → AI-assisted development — what took 6 months now takes weeks
  → Cloud infrastructure costs dropped 90% with recent specialized cloud solutions like Vercel, Supabase, Railway. I found compute on E2E 70% cheaper than AWS
  → Enterprise-grade open-source tools — Next.js, React, PostgreSQL etc

  The Democratization of AI market is projected to grow from $11.4B (2023) to $119.9B by 2033. McKinsey reports that what required "entire engineering teams just two years ago" can now be built by individuals.


For MSMEs/Individuals there were two options:

- Spend a lot of money on building software to have their own digital assets
-  Pay monthly rent to SaaS platforms to have digital presence of their business.

Now there is a 3rd option:

- Build custom software at a fraction of the cost — and own it completely.


What this means:

  The 60+ million MSMEs — property dealers, contractors, manufacturers — can now own their digital infrastructure instead of renting it.

  No more paying commissions on every lead.
  No more generic workflows that don't fit how you work.
  No more building someone else's platform with your data.

  The question is no longer "can you afford custom software?"

  It's "can you afford NOT to own?"


  Own your leads. Own your data. Own your brand.

  Software is no longer a luxury for the big players.

  It's a commodity — and the smart ones are already building.



## Good Start to catch attention of the audience

```The Shift: Software is Now a Commodity
Three forces have converged:

AI-Assisted Development — What took 6 months now takes weeks
Cloud Infrastructure Commoditization — Hosting costs dropped 90% (Vercel, Supabase, etc.)
Open-Source Maturity — Next.js, Prisma, React — enterprise-grade tools, free
The result: The Democratization of AI market is projected to grow from $11.4B (2023) to $119.9B by 2033. McKinsey reports that what required "entire engineering teams just two years ago" can now be built by individuals.

## This section is a differentiator about what is standard offering vs specific needs which only MSMEs/Individual can realise


```But more importantly — the customization:

Indian property types (Plot, Flat, Shop) — not Zillow's "Single Family Home"
Owner phone tracking — platforms hide this to control the relationship
Front/back dimensions — specific to Indian plot sales
Service categories for construction — because he's not just a dealer, he's a builder```


##  This is the good narrative for my company

```The Narrative for Your Company
Who You Serve
The invisible middle — business owners who:

Earn ₹20-80 lakhs/year
Are too big for Instagram/WhatsApp-only presence
Are too small for ₹50 lakh custom development
Have been told "use 99acres" or "make a Wix site"
Never imagined owning a custom digital asset
What You Offer
Not websites. Not apps. Digital infrastructure.

Lead generation systems they own (no commission sharing)
Customer databases they control (no platform lock-in)
Brand presence that's theirs (not a subdomain)
Workflows customized to how they actually work
The Unique Positioning
"We build what you couldn't afford yesterday — at a price you can afford today."

Or more specifically:

"Your competitor is paying ₹50,000/month to rent their digital presence. You can own yours for less than what they pay in 3 months."
