## Here is ny thought





## Good Start to catch attention of the audience

```The Shift: Software is Now a Commodity
Three forces have converged:

AI-Assisted Development — What took 6 months now takes weeks
Cloud Infrastructure Commoditization — Hosting costs dropped 90% (Vercel, Supabase, etc.)
Open-Source Maturity — Next.js, Prisma, React — enterprise-grade tools, free
The result: The Democratization of AI market is projected to grow from $11.4B (2023) to $119.9B by 2033. McKinsey reports that what required "entire engineering teams just two years ago" can now be built by individuals.
```

## This section is a differentiator about what is standard offering vs specific needs which only MSMEs/Individual can realise


```But more importantly — the customization:

Indian property types (Plot, Flat, Shop) — not Zillow's "Single Family Home"
Owner phone tracking — platforms hide this to control the relationship
Front/back dimensions — specific to Indian plot sales
Service categories for construction — because he's not just a dealer, he's a builder```


##  This is the good narrative for my company

```The Narrative for Your Company
Who You Serve
The invisible middle — business owners who:

Earn ₹20-80 lakhs/year
Are too big for Instagram/WhatsApp-only presence
Are too small for ₹50 lakh custom development
Have been told "use 99acres" or "make a Wix site"
Never imagined owning a custom digital asset
What You Offer
Not websites. Not apps. Digital infrastructure.

Lead generation systems they own (no commission sharing)
Customer databases they control (no platform lock-in)
Brand presence that's theirs (not a subdomain)
Workflows customized to how they actually work
The Unique Positioning
"We build what you couldn't afford yesterday — at a price you can afford today."

Or more specifically:

"Your competitor is paying ₹50,000/month to rent their digital presence. You can own yours for less than what they pay in 3 months."
```
